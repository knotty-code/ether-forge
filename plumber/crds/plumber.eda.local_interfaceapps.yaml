              Listen up — this is Jack Burton in the Pork Chop Express,
              and InterfaceAppSpec is the rig that tells me what kinda freight you're haulin' across these nodes.
              You throw in your nodes, ports, speed, type — all the good stuff — and ol' Jack
              takes it from there, configurin' interfaces like thunder rollin' through Chinatown.
              It's all about gettin' the job done clean and mean, no fuss, no drift, just pure network power.
              You know what ol' Jack Burton says? It's all in the reflexes.
