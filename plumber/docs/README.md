# Jack Burton's Plumber App Guide

Listen up, you primitive screwheads — this is **Jack Burton** talkin', straight from the driver's seat of the **Pork Chop Express**.

This plumber app? It's the rig that hauls your interface configs and links across the network without gettin' stuck in config drift hell. You throw in your nodes, port ranges, speed, type — hell, even LLDP and encapsulation — and ol' Jack lights up those ethernet ports like thunder rollin' through Chinatown. Then it automatically builds TopoLinks so your topology looks sharp and clean — no more guessin' who's connected to who.

Why build on EDA with plumber?  
Simple: EDA is deterministic, declarative, and event-driven — you say what you want, and the app makes it happen. No deltas, no order worries, just pure network freight delivered. Bulk configure interfaces, generate links, and watch Jack rant in the logs while it all comes together.

Just remember what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes and the poison arrows fall: EDA (and plumber) drives right through it.

**It's all in the reflexes.**

Now pay me — this network ain't plumbin' itself.
